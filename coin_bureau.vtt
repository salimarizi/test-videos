00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.080
it was one of the costliest corporate

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.200
scandals of all time one that left a

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.160
venerable brand in tatters a scandal

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.679
that allowed one of the biggest

5
00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.840
companies in the world to claim esg

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.320
credentials while still polluting the

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.600
atmosphere

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.840
it's a scandal that still haunts the

9
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.400
automotive industry to this day and it's

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.119
what i'll be covering in this video so

11
00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.510
don't go anywhere

12

[Music]

13
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.079
before we switch on the ignition we need

14
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.120
a disclaimer to aid your cognition

15
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.520
giving financial advice isn't part of my

16
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.920
mission education and entertainment are

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680
my only emissions

18
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.760
so contact a financial advisor if your

19
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.840
finances look fishy

20
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.600
to those who only just stumbled into

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.760
this place please try not to be put off

22
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320
by this face my name is guy and here at

23
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.199
the coin bureau is where i reside

24

my team and i provide you with the best

can't buy

27
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.119
that's right no adverts or sponsored

28
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.439
shout outs to endure just a whole lot of

29
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.720
knowledge unsullied and pure if that

30
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.320
sounds like something that's up your

avenue hit subscribe and the bell icon

32

so you'll know when the next video's due

33
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.759
okay now that's all done and dusted

34
00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.159
let's find out which naughty company got

35
00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.960
itself busted

36
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.119
the volkswagen emissions scandal

37
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.360
sometimes known as dieselgate or

38
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.000
emissionsgate dates back to september

39
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.159
2015 when the united states

40
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.360
environmental protection agency epa

41
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.680
issued a notice of violation of the

42
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.320
clean air act to german carmaker

43
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.680
volkswagen

44
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.399
the agency had found that volkswagen had

45
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.119
intentionally programmed turbocharged

46
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.640
direct injection tdi diesel engines to

47
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.280
only activate their emissions controls

48
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.920
during laboratory testing

49
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.320
vw admitted to installing what are

50
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.520
called defeat devices in millions of its

51
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.680
diesel-powered cars

52
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.479
this saw technical software detect when

53
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.640
cars were being tested for compliance

54
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.239
with emissions rules

55
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.160
this software then adjusted the

56
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.239
diesel-powered engines so that they

57
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.720
passed the compliance tests

58
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.520
however in normal use it was discovered

59
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.840
that these engines emitted far more

60
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.959
pollution including up to 40 times more

61
00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.680
nitrogen dioxide than the permitted

62
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.800
levels

63
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
and this had all been going on for years

64
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.120
now to this day it's still largely

65
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.440
unknown how many employees and

66
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.680
executives knew about these defeat

67
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.760
devices what they were doing and why

68
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
but what's even more staggering is that

69
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.080
vw which had always positioned itself in

70
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.319
the minds of automotive aficionados as

71
00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.920
one of the most advanced and

72
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.640
cutting-edge vehicle producers deployed

73
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.400
this emissions cheating software in

74
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.720
about 11 million cars worldwide

75
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.920
including 500 000 in the us in model

76
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.920
years 2009 through to 2015.

77
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.000
now if you're wondering how the heck

78
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.760
volkswagen managed to get away

79
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.239
undetected with its pollution scheme for

80
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.879
so many years and how it was finally

81
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.560
caught by regulators

82
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.360
well here's some background for you

83
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.400
now in 2014 the california air resources

84
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.879
board or carb commissioned from the

85
00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.480
international council on clean

86
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.720
transportation icct

87
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.879
a study on emissions discrepancies

88
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.040
between european and u.s models of

89
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.680
vehicles summing up the data on 15

90
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.879
vehicles from three different sources

91
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.120
among those recruited for this task was

92
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.280
a group of five scientists at the west

93
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.200
virginia university center for

94
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.799
alternative fuels engines and emissions

95
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.360
these five scientists used a japanese

96
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.360
onboard emission test system and

97
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.760
detected additional emissions during

98
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.640
live road tests on two out of three

99
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.159
diesel cars

100
00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.439
the icct furthermore purchased data from

101
00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.360
two other sources

102
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.280
the data-driven outcome induced

103
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.360
international regulators to investigate

104
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.680
volkswagen which subsequently caused its

105
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.880
stock price to fall in value by a third

106
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.959
in the days immediately after the news

107
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.918
broke

108
00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.400
the combination of bad news partnered

109
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.479
with the growing concerns regarding the

110
00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.000
potential wrongdoing within the

111
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.680
volkswagen organization led vw group ceo

112
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.479
martin vintercorn to resign

113
00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.479
on top of that the head of brand

114
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.639
development at volkswagen heinz jacob

115
00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.880
neuser audi research and development

116
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.520
head ulrich huckenberg and porsche

117
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.360
research and development head wolfgang

118
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.160
hats were also suspended

119
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.400
in light of the allegations in april

120
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.800
2016 volkswagen announced plans to spend

121
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.800
16.2 billion euros on rectifying the

122
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.360
emissions issues and planned to refit

123
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.520
the affected vehicles as part of a

124
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.600
recall campaign

125
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.479
but then in january 2017 volkswagen

126
00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.039
pleaded guilty to criminal charges and

127
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.280
signed an agreed statement of facts

128
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.960
which drew on the results of an

129
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.440
investigation volkswagen had itself

130
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.160
commissioned from u.s lawyers

131
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.400
the statement set out how engineers had

132
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.639
developed and built the defeat devices

133
00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.520
because diesel models could not pass u.s

134
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.440
emissions tests without them and

135
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.880
deliberately sought to conceal their use

136
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.160
consequently in april 2017 a u.s federal

137
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.000
judge ordered volkswagen to pay a

138
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.639
whopping 2.8 billion dollar criminal

139
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.280
fine for quote rigging diesel-powered

140
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.199
vehicles to cheat on government

141
00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.120
emissions tests

142
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.840
subsequently ex-ceo vintacorn was

143
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.080
charged in the united states with fraud

144
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.840
and conspiracy on the 3rd of may 2018

145
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.600
but what's even more staggering about

146
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.120
this is that as of june 2020 the scandal

147
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.039
had cost the german manufacturer up to

148
00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.160
33.3 billion

149
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.400
due to fines penalties financial

150
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.440
settlements and buyback costs

151
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.919
at present various government and civil

152
00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.319
actions are ongoing in the u.s and the

153
00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.319
european union where most of the

154
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.720
affected vehicles are located

155
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
while these vehicles remain legal to

156
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.280
drive in the eu consumer groups and

157
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.199
governments have sought to make sure

158
00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.520
that vw has compensated owners

159
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.759
appropriately as it has had to do in the

160
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.120
us

161
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.280
now the scandal raised awareness over

162
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.600
the higher levels of pollution emitted

163
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.840
by the vast majority of diesel-powered

164
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.919
engines from a wide range of car

165
00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.000
manufacturers which under real-world

166
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.400
driving conditions exceeded legal

167
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.080
emission limits

168
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.160
for instance a study conducted by the

169
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.880
adac the largest european motoring

170
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.199
organization showed the largest

171
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.520
emissions deviations from producers like

172
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.120
volvo renault jeep hyundai citron and

173
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.199
feared which naturally resulted in

174
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.680
investigations opening into other diesel

175
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.440
emissions scandals

176
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.840
on that note a discussion was sparked on

177
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.599
the topic of software controlled

178
00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.759
machinery being generally prone to

179
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.680
cheating with a possible way out of this

180
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.080
system entailing the open sourcing of

181
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.039
the software for public scrutiny

182
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.759
and with that it's time to get a bit

183
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.720
technical so here's the science bit

184
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.880
concentrate

185
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.360
the 1980s saw the development of

186
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.759
three-way catalytic converter technology

187
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.000
which was very effective at reducing

188
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.240
nitrogen dioxide in petrol engine

189
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.199
exhaust

190
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.919
however it did not work well for diesel

191
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.199
vehicles as unless treated these emit 20

192
00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.919
times more nitrogen dioxide than petrol

193
00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.199
engines

194
00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.360
to deal with this dysfunctionality in

195
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.720
2005 a number of managers at volkswagen

196
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.639
intended to purchase the rights to

197
00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.759
mercedes's bulky expensive and high

198
00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.840
maintenance treatment system called

199
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.319
blu-tec for reducing diesel exhaust

200
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:03.680
pollution

201
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.479
other vw managers rejected blue tech and

202
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.479
preferred to develop their own cheaper

203
00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.360
solution called lnt

204
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.000
the lnt team won

205
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.639
but surprise surprise their solution

206
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.960
didn't actually work

207
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.759
now i will say that overall abiding by

208
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:23.440
technical compliance in the automotive

209
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.520
industry has often proven to be

210
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.120
incredibly hard

211
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.960
for instance since 2016 38 out of 40

212
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.799
diesel cars of all brands tested by adac

213
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.760
reportedly failed a no nitrogen dioxide

214
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.880
test based on government standards

215
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.919
nonetheless vw promoted and marketed

216
00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.000
what seemed to be the technological

217
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.200
miracle of fast cheap consumer-friendly

218
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.360
green diesel vehicles

219
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.600
on paper that is in reality the system

220
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.000
failed to combine low fuel consumption

221
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.920
with compliant nitrogen dioxide

222
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.760
emissions and in 2006 vw actively chose

223
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.240
to program its engine control units to

224
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.399
switch from lower fuel consumption and

225
00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.800
high emissions to low emission compliant

226
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.720
mode when an emissions test was detected

227
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.200
essentially this led volkswagen-designed

228
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.839
engines to emit nitrogen dioxide levels

229
00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:22.000
well above the permitted limit in daily

230
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.640
operation and to comply with the u.s

231
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.120
nitrogen dioxide standards when being

232
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.440
tested thereby constituting what is

233
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.040
commonly referred to as a defeat device

234
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.160
in fact in 2015 the german news magazine

235
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.560
de spiegel reported that at least 30

236
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.040
people at management level in vw had

237
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.440
known about the deceit for years of

238
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.000
course vw denied these allegations

239
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.440
entirely

240
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.080
now starting in the 2009 model year the

241
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.920
volkswagen group reportedly began

242
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.720
migrating its diesel engines to a common

243
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.959
rail fuel injection system

244
00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:59.120
in technical terms this system allows

245
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.360
for higher precision fuel delivery which

246
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.279
theoretically leads to better fuel

247
00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:05.760
processing and by default to better

248
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.839
emissions control

249
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.519
since 2009 vw has described its diesel

250
00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:14.160
engines as being as clean as if not

251
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.640
cleaner than the us and californian

252
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.640
requirements while providing good fuel

253
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.519
economy and exceptional performance

254
00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.519
and what's especially curious about this

255
00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.600
is that due to the apparently efficient

256
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.519
fuel economy provided by its diesel

257
00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:31.040
engines in 2014 vw was registered with

258
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.200
an impressive corporate average fuel

259
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.640
economy rate

260
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.720
the seemingly low emission levels of

261
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.040
vw's vehicles tested with the defeat

262
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.640
device in operation

263
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.959
enabled the company to receive green car

264
00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:45.360
subsidies and even tax exemptions in the

265
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.200
united states

266
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.680
okay so volkswagen's engines were now

267
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.519
deemed green and environmentally

268
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.920
friendly but how were these alleged

269
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.079
emissions discrepancies discovered by

270
00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:59.440
analysts testers and regulators well

271
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.600
let's have a look shall we

272
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.000
now in 2014 a group of scientists at

273
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.079
west virginia university submitted a

274
00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:08.320
proposal to the international council on

275
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.240
clean transportation

276
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.600
and the co-lead of the us branch of icct

277
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.000
john german awarded the student group a

278
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.720
50 000 grant for a study to conduct

279
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.200
tests on three diesel cars

280
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.839
namely a volkswagen passat a volkswagen

281
00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:28.480
jetta and a bmw x5 the icct also

282
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.880
purchased data from emissions analytics

283
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.360
a uk-based emissions consulting firm to

284
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.760
gain an additional more rounded estimate

285
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.279
on the study

286
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:40.000
now in early 2014 two professors and two

287
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.920
students from west virginia university

288
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.079
began measuring and testing emissions

289
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.720
from the three vehicles under real-world

290
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.320
road conditions

291
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.000
these three vehicles were all

292
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.160
individually certified at a california

293
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.560
air resources board facility before the

294
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.800
tests as falling below the emissions

295
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.639
limits when using the standard

296
00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:01.040
laboratory testing protocols pretty

297
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.480
smooth right

298
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.040
well not so fast

299
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.120
the researchers drove the volkswagen

300
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.519
passat from los angeles to seattle and

301
00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.000
back again covering most of the u.s west

302
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.160
coast and testing the passat's emissions

303
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.639
over 2000 miles

304
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.200
with regards to the bmw x5 the

305
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200
researchers found that the vehicle was

306
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.360
at or below the standard permitted

307
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.120
emissions rate

308
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.519
but under real driving conditions they

309
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.600
found the volkswagen jetta greatly

310
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.160
exceeded the us's emissions limit by a

311
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.600
factor of 15 to 35 whereas the passat

312
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.680
exceeded the allowed levels by a factor

313
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.680
of 5 to 20.

314
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.000
that is quite a discrepancy between the

315
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.320
lab-based tests and those executed in

316
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.160
real-world conditions

317
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.079
clearly the emissions thoroughly

318
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:50.240
exceeded legal limits set by both

319
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.120
european and u.s standards

320
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.200
thus john german while analyzing the

321
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.440
apparent deceit initially argued that it

322
00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.839
required a lot more effort than simply

323
00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:02.240
adding some code to the engine software

324
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.160
as the code would have inevitably been

325
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
validated by the analysts and

326
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.600
researchers

327
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.600
however the research scientists did not

328
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.000
identify the defeat device itself in the

329
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.040
passat and jetta models they did however

330
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.959
report their findings in a study they

331
00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:18.959
presented to the california air

332
00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:22.320
resources board in may 2014

333
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.200
that same month colorado's rapid screen

334
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.120
real-world emissions test data once

335
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.519
again reinforced the allegations of

336
00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:32.000
volkswagen's suspected abnormally high

337
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.519
emissions levels and after a year-long

338
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.600
investigation concerning the internal

339
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.320
mechanisms of the vw's engines an

340
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.160
international team of investigators

341
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.480
identified the defeat device as a piece

342
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.680
of code labeled acoustic condition which

343
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.399
activated emissions curbing systems when

344
00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.720
the car's computer identified it was

345
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.480
undergoing a test

346
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.560
perhaps a bit too sophisticated a

347
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.199
functionality for a standard acoustic

348
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:02.320
condition device don't you think

349
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.480
of course the data-driven findings by

350
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.880
researchers and investigators led to the

351
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.279
u.s environmental protection agency

352
00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.760
filing a notice of violation against the

353
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.079
german car manufacturer on the 18th of

354
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:17.839
september 2015. the epa thus served a

355
00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:20.480
notice of violation on the volkswagen

356
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.279
group alleging that approximately 480

357
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.240
000 volkswagen and audi cars equipped

358
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.959
with 2-liter tdi engines and sold in the

359
00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:32.320
u.s between 2009 and 2015 had an

360
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.040
emissions compliance defeat device

361
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.480
installed

362
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.639
now according to the epa the defeat

363
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:40.959
device used by volkswagen detected the

364
00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.560
position of the steering wheel the

365
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.399
vehicle's speed the duration of the

366
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.800
engine's mechanical operation and its

367
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.040
barometric pressure

368
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.959
but what was particularly ingenious

369
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.880
about this entire process was that the

370
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.800
criteria written into the underlying

371
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.959
structure of the defeat devices

372
00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:59.600
very closely matched the epa's required

373
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.760
emissions testing protocol which allowed

374
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.079
the vehicle to comply with emissions

375
00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.720
regulations by properly activating all

376
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.440
emission controls during testing

377
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.560
criminally clever you might say

378
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.800
but the epa's noticed a violation

379
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.399
alleged that under normal driving

380
00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:18.639
conditions the software suppressed the

381
00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:20.880
emissions controls allowing for better

382
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.199
fuel economy at the expense of emitting

383
00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:26.240
up to 40 times more nitrogen dioxide

384
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.800
than allowed by law

385
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.279
according to the epa volkswagen had

386
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.600
insisted for over a year before the

387
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.120
outbreak of the scandal that the

388
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.040
emissions discrepancies were mere

389
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.560
technical glitches

390
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.959
but when confronted with official

391
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:43.519
evidence on the use of defeat devices

392
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.920
volkswagen fully acknowledged that it

393
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.399
had manipulated the tests

394
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.240
now the first sign that volkswagen was

395
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.399
ready to come clean reportedly came on

396
00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.360
the 21st of august 2015 at a conference

397
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.000
on green transportation at pacific grove

398
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.240
california where an unnamed company

399
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.399
representative approached christopher

400
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:05.279
grundler director of the epa office of

401
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.440
transportation and air quality and

402
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.759
surprised him by informally admitting

403
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.920
that the company had been deceiving

404
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.360
regulators

405
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.600
and a california air resources board

406
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.240
official apparently was standing next to

407
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.399
grundler at the time

408
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.320
but formal acknowledgement of the

409
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.480
deception was made by volkswagen

410
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.560
executives in germany and the united

411
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.440
states to epa and california officials

412
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.680
during a conference call in september

413
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.040
2015. during which volkswagen executives

414
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.519
discussed written materials provided to

415
00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.839
the participants which showed how

416
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:42.160
volkswagen's diesel engine software

417
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.360
circumvented u.s emissions tests

418
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.680
that admission came after the epa

419
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.920
threatened to withhold approval for the

420
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.639
company's 2016 volkswagen and audi

421
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.240
diesel models

422
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.560
volkswagen consequently announced that

423
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.199
11 million of its manufactured cars had

424
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.519
been involved in falsified emissions

425
00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:04.480
reports and that over 7 billion dollars

426
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.319
would be ultimately earmarked to deal

427
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.079
with the costs of rectifying the

428
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.280
software at the heart of the scandal

429
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.760
in light of this in november 2015

430
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.079
volkswagen officially announced that in

431
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.919
addition to the two thousand dollars it

432
00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:20.160
was offering current vw owners for

433
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.319
trade-ins of their

434
00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.480
non-emissions-compliant cars

435
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.640
482 000 diesel audi and volkswagen

436
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.319
owners in the united states would be

437
00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.200
eligible to receive 1 000

438
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.880
in vouchers

439
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.120
following its admission and recall plans

440
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.280
in the united states volkswagen also

441
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.360
began to establish similar plans in the

442
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.679
european union where it was estimated

443
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:44.640
that 8.5 million of the 11 million

444
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.559
diesel-powered vehicles affected by the

445
00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:49.039
scandal were located

446
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:51.760
in fact in 2018 the european union

447
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.600
warned volkswagen that it did not

448
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.600
believe that it was moving fast enough

449
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.320
to issue repairs on recalled cars

450
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.080
provide consumers with appropriate

451
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.400
information on what steps vw was doing

452
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.480
to resolve the problem and what

453
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.799
compensation it was offering affected

454
00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:09.760
consumers in light of this volkswagen

455
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.320
agreed to pay a 1 billion euro fine

456
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.480
imposed by germany for failing to

457
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.559
monitor the employees that modified the

458
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:19.200
software behind the emissions scandal

459
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.520
but folks it gets worse

460
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.559
in germany over 60 000 civil lawsuits of

461
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:27.679
various degrees representing about 450

462
00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:30.559
000 citizens were filed from 2015

463
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:33.840
through to 2019 by vw owners seeking

464
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.000
similar compensation to what volkswagen

465
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.799
had awarded drivers in the us

466
00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:41.120
and a case led by the federation of

467
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.840
german consumer organizations was also

468
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.080
brought against volkswagen

469
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.480
at the higher regional court volkswagen

470
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.400
argued that while the united states had

471
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.200
banned the affected cars no eu member

472
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.919
state had done so and thus there was no

473
00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:58.320
basis for compensation

474
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.720
however judge michael nayef rejected a

475
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.400
summary judgment for volkswagen in

476
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.120
september 2019 allowing what was

477
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.520
anticipated to be a multi-year case to

478
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.960
go forward

479
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.600
in february 2020 volkswagen had settled

480
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.440
with the federation of german consumer

481
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.320
organizations for approximately 830

482
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.520
million euros providing between 1.3 and

483
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.679
6.2 000 euros to roughly 260 000

484
00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:25.520
volkswagen owners

485
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.000
as was to be expected many consumers

486
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.080
were deeply angered by this settlement

487
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.520
as it thoroughly undermined the

488
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520
compensation structure that affected

489
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.440
volkswagen drivers had previously

490
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.679
received in the u.s

491
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:40.400
a civil suit filed by one vw driver

492
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.320
managed to reach the federal court of

493
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.440
justice germany's supreme court and in

494
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.080
may 2020 the supreme court ruled that

495
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.240
the consumer was entitled to a

496
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.799
compensation package entailing the full

497
00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.880
market value of the car which was

498
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.640
several times larger than what the

499
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.280
settlement would have originally offered

500
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.000
however it still remains unclear how

501
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.720
much volkswagen will effectively owe as

502
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.440
a result of the civil lawsuits

503
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.360
a similar class action lawsuit against

504
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.000
volkswagen representing more than 91 000

505
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.400
owners is currently underway in the uk

506
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.480
seeking greater compensation for being

507
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.200
sold vehicles known by volkswagen to be

508
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.720
defective

509
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.360
in april 2020 the high court of justice

510
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.840
gave its preliminary findings stating

511
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.360
that there was a likelihood that

512
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.679
volkswagen sold cars with a defeat

513
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:32.159
device installed and thus allowing the

514
00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:35.280
trial to go forward now setting monetary

515
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.039
compensation structures aside for a

516
00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:38.640
second perhaps the most harrowing

517
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.039
component of this scandal is the impact

518
00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.440
that vehicles with built-in non-emission

519
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.760
compliant defeat devices are having on

520
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.440
the environment

521
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.200
the consequences of producing

522
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.120
diesel-powered vehicles that do not

523
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.280
respect international legal limits in

524
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.159
terms of pollution are dire

525
00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.159
for instance a peer-reviewed study

526
00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:00.080
published in environmental research

527
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.720
letters estimated that approximately 59

528
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.799
premature deaths will be caused by the

529
00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:07.520
excess pollution generated between 2008

530
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.320
and 2015 by vehicles equipped with the

531
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.960
defeat device in the united states

532
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.080
the study completed in 2015 also found

533
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.919
that making these vehicles emissions

534
00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:20.480
compliant by the start of 2016 would

535
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.039
avert an additional

536
00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:24.880
130 early deaths

537
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.039
earlier peer-reviewed studies quoted

538
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:30.400
estimates ranging from 10 to 350 excess

539
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.960
deaths in the united states related to

540
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.039
the defeat devices

541
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:37.120
but perhaps most harrowing of all was a

542
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.440
study completed in 2022 in which

543
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.840
economists argued that every cheating

544
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.799
volkswagen car in every 1000 cars on the

545
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:48.720
road caused a 1.7 increase in infant

546
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.159
mortality

547
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:52.640
on top of this on a global scale

548
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.400
vehicles that do not comply with

549
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.159
international pollution standards

550
00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:58.559
release an excessive amount of nitrogen

551
00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:01.280
dioxide which consequently leads to

552
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.559
higher levels of smog and acid rain

553
00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:07.039
what these studies show is that the cars

554
00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.640
carrying the defeat devices were not

555
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.200
only bad for the environment but took a

556
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.000
toll on human life as well

557
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.080
food for thought for all you vw

558
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.240
aficionados out there

559
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.799
so with that in mind let's see how all

560
00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:23.440
of this affected volkswagen shall we

561
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.000
on the 21st of september 2015 the first

562
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.320
day of trading after the epa's notice of

563
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.880
violation to volkswagen became public

564
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.600
the share price of volkswagen ag fell by

565
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.919
a whopping 20 on the frankfurt stock

566
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.360
exchange

567
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.360
the next day the stock fell by another

568
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.120
12 dropping below 100 euros to record a

569
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.919
four-year low before regaining some lost

570
00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:47.520
ground

571
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.840
share prices of other german automakers

572
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.480
were also affected with bmw down 4.9

573
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.919
percent and daimler down 5.8 percent

574
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.320
as a result of plummeting share prices

575
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.559
qatar one of the biggest volkswagen

576
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:03.280
shareholders with a 17 stake in the

577
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.320
company lost nearly 5 billion

578
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.960
as the company's stock value fell

579
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.720
this market volatility was also

580
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.559
reflected in the sales performance of

581
00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.720
volkswagen vehicles pointing towards a

582
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.200
staggering 24 decline in sales in the us

583
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.520
surprisingly in the uk the scandal did

584
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.280
not affect sales which actually

585
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.240
increased in 2016 to an all-time high

586
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.640
placing volkswagen second in the league

587
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.320
of best-selling cars

588
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.480
not a great reflection on us brits

589
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.679
really

590
00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:36.480
moreover documents obtained by cee bank

591
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.640
watch network provided details for the

592
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.520
european investment bank eib statement

593
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.440
that its loans to volkswagen may have

594
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.760
been connected to the car makers use of

595
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.720
cheating devices to rig emissions tests

596
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.960
in fact during the bank's annual press

597
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.520
conference on the 14th of january 2016

598
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.159
its president verna hoya admitted that

599
00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:58.480
the 400 million euro loan might have

600
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.559
been used in the creation of the

601
00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.799
emissions defeat device

602
00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:05.279
at that time many redacted documents

603
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:08.000
obtained by bankwatch along with the eib

604
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
not entirely disclosing the details of

605
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.240
its loan hinted towards the bank

606
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.559
possibly already knowing that there were

607
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.480
some discrepancies with the internal

608
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.720
mechanisms of volkswagen's diesel

609
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.919
engines

610
00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:23.200
however in 2017 the european anti-fraud

611
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.720
office olaf

612
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.440
found that volkswagen had in fact misled

613
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.760
the bank about its use of emissions

614
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.600
cheating software

615
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.360
now as you can imagine the volkswagen

616
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.279
scandal did not go down well in the

617
00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:38.080
media reuters argued that the crisis at

618
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.000
volkswagen could have been a bigger

619
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.919
threat to the german economy than the

620
00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.080
consequences of the greek sovereign debt

621
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.400
crisis of 2015.

622
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.240
deutsche weller a german state

623
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.200
broadcaster stated that quote a lawsuit

624
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.600
tsunami was headed for volkswagen at the

625
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.679
time with the scandal tarnishing the

626
00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:58.000
volkswagen brand and the image of

627
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.200
germany by extension this was a case of

628
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.480
wide scale cynical deceit and volkswagen

629
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
is still paying the price for its

630
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.320
actions to this day

631
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.240
and the company's logic in all of this

632
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.919
is also incredibly difficult to

633
00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.120
understand

634
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.960
rather than seek to produce more

635
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.600
environmentally friendly cars it instead

636
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.159
opted to cheat its way past regulators

637
00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:22.960
and cynically maximize profits as a

638
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.520
result it ended up having to part with

639
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.400
billions in fines and compensation deals

640
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.480
money which could have been better spent

641
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.039
actually lowering the emissions of its

642
00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.320
vehicles

643
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.559
it just goes to show that even the most

644
00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.039
well-respected and well-established

645
00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:41.520
international companies aren't above

646
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.240
shady practices in the name of profit

647
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.159
well i hope you enjoyed that one folks

648
00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:50.320
but i would love your feedback on this
